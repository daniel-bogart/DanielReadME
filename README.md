# Hello!

My name is Daniel and I'm a frontend software engineer and web developer with years of experience building complex web applications using the latest technologies such as React.js, Redux.js, JavaScript, TypeScript (ect.) with the ability to connect them to a Ruby on Rails or MERN style Backend.

After graduating a from a highly competative bootcamp, I got my start at a fast growing time-series database startup where I was responsible for building and maintaining web properties, conducting A/B testing along with creating dashboards for marketing analysis, devOps, distributed design systems, and planning a rebrand.

Taking what I learned from my time in the world of a tech startup and my own free time, I began to freelance for both businesses and individuals, building websites from scratch, working with world class designers, and ever expanding my knowledge and love for web development. I care deeply about function, feel, learning and implementing new best practices, and am ultimately a builder at heart.
